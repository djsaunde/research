# Books

The file `read.csv` contains the titles, some metadata, and a brief synopsis of some books I've read, and `read.bib` contains the corresponding LaTeX bibliography file. As of now, this is very much incomplete.

The file `planned.csv` contains a list of books (and some metadata) that I'm planning to read.
