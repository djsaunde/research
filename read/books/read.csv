Your Brain is a Time Machine,2018-04-01,http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Your-Brain-Is-a-Time-Machine/,None,"It is argued that the human brain is a complex system that not only tells time, but creates it, constructing our sense of chronological movement and enabling mental time travel; i.e., simulations of past and future events. These functions were and are essential for the evolution of the human race, allowing us to anticipate the need for tools and farming."
The Computer and the Brain,2018-05-01,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=578873,Neumann:1958:CB:578873,The building blocks and working mechansims of computers and biological brains are compared and contrasted. Von Neumann attempts to explain some of the workings of the nervous system from the point of view of a mathematician.
Deep Learning,2018-06-01,http://www.deeplearningbook.org/,Goodfellow-et-al-2016,"The nascent field of deep learning is described starting with machine learning basics, working through established deep learning concepts (multilayer networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, training strategies, and applications), and culminating in an in-depth discussion of research topics. Basic calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics are all that's needed to understand most of the material."
Computer Age Statistical Inference,2018-07-01,https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/,efron_hastie_2016,"The history of the development of statistical methods and justification of those methods is divided into three periods: classic statistical inference, early computer-age methods, and 21st century topics. Each statistical method is discussed in terms of their frequentist, Bayesian, or Fisherian justification(s), and examples with real datasets are common throughout. The authors describe how the development of statistical algorithms is out-pacing their inferential justification thanks to powerful and cheap computation and the collection of massive, interesting datasets."
